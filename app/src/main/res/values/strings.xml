    <string name="strTextoDescricao">The Estudonauta idea was born in 2016 and since then several test videos have been recorded to validate the idea and model the format. At the end of 2017 Alpha Testing was opened for 200 Founding students and at the end of 2018 Beta Testing was opened for many others. The platform today has hundreds of classes, divided into several courses that are being launched in modules.
